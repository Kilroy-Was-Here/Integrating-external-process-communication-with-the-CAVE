The documents on this repository come from my research work of summer 2022. This work was presented at the CAAV Conference on November 4, 2021. The python code is run in Vizard to generate a globe with a real cloud layer taken from a website that scans the cloud layer currently over the Earth. The cloud scanning website requires a paid subscription, so for people who don't have that subscription, there are some videos of the code's output on this repository.
