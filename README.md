The documents on this repository come from my research work of summer 2021. This work was presented at the CAAV Conference on November 4, 2021. This code was made by Benjamin Kilroy, Frank Klassner, Vijay Gehlot, and Andrew Grace. The python code is run in Vizard to generate a 3D model of the Earth with a real cloud layer taken from a website that scans the cloud layer currently over the Earth. The cloud scanning website requires a paid subscription, so for people who don't have that subscription, there are some videos of the code's output on this repository.
